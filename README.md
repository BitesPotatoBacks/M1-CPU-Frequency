# ðŸ“° News!
I just started a new project, [Frequency Stats](https://github.com/BitesPotatoBacks/FrequencyStats), which is a menubar app that provides CPU and GPU frequency metrics without needing to install a dameon or a kext. It was inspired by this tool, check it out if you want something more convenient for frequency monitoring! New features to come!

## Project Deets
### Wat it do
SocPowerBuddy samples counter values from the IOReport (across a sampling interval) and returns accurate averages of the related metric.

It is based on reverse engineering `powermetrics`, and reports every statistic offered by `powermetrics -s cpu_power,gpu_power` (see [full metric list](#features) and [example output](#example)), yet without needing `sudo`. Note that some metrics and features are exclusive to this project, those of which you will not find in `powermetrics`.

Officially tested on M1, as well as M1 Pro, Max, and Ultra (see [compatibility notes](#compatibility-notes))

### Why it do
Because needing to be system admin in order to monitor Apple Silicon frequencies is dumb (yeah, I'm looking at you, `powermetrics`). So here you go! No administrative privileges needed! 

### Example Output
**Note:** The following is a nice big juicy output of `socpwrbud` running on a Macmini9,1.

## Outside Influence
This project has recently influenced the CPU/GPU power related metric gathering on [NeoAsitop](https://github.com/op06072/NeoAsitop)! Yay! Go check it out :heart:

## Compatibility Notes
Here's a sick table. 
| Silicon | Codename | Support Status |
|----|---|---|
| M1 | t8103 | Fully Working |
| M1 Pro | t6000 | Works (But no tests for binned 8-Core model) |
| M1 Max | t6001 | Fully Working |
| M1 Ultra | t6002 | Fully Working (see [#5](https://github.com/BitesPotatoBacks/SocPowerBuddy/issues/5) and patch [v0.3.1](https://github.com/BitesPotatoBacks/SocPowerBuddy/releases/tag/v0.3.1)) |
| M2 | t8112 | Should work? |
| M2 Pro | t6020 | Should work? |
| M2 Max | t6021 | Should work? |

## Contribution
If any bugs or issues are found, please let me know in the [issues](https://github.com/BitesPotatoBacks/SocPowerBuddy/issues) section. If the problem is related to missing IOReport entries, please share the output of the `iorepdump` tool found in the [latest release](https://github.com/BitesPotatoBacks/SocPowerBuddy/releases/latest). Feel free to open a PR if you know what you're doing :smile:
